      <h1>Has the Pandemic Made Cycling a Commuting Option?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h4>by Dimitri Fautsch on November 12, 2020 </h4>
      <p>In September, Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg affirmed a ‘cycling boom’ since April in New York City and attributed the growth to weekend riders. There were 2.1 million weekend trips in 2019 compared to 2.9
        million
        trips in 2020 from May through October. People have replaced the subway with cycling, according to Trottenberg. </p>
      <p>Weekday ridership is a different story. The totals, during the same time period, are basically equal with 6.1 million riders in both 2019 and 2020. However, the totals mask a dip in weekday cycling in the early months of the pandemic and a
        corresponding increase through the Summer and into the Fall.</p>
      <p>While it’s clear people have adopted cycling as a leisure activity, it’s hard to say if people have turned to bicycles for commuting since the pandemic. People may be riding bikes on the weekdays for exercise. As the weather cools but fear
        of
        commuting by subway persists we may be able to say that the pandemic has made more bicycle commuters.</p>
